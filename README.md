  ## Description
  For this assignment I was instructed to create an employee tracker using mySQL2. I first created a database that would hold keys/values for the departments, roles, and employees. Then I seeded the databases with example employees and assigned them roles and departments. I then created functions using inquirer to create prompts so the user can navigate the app. By connecting my js file to mySQL2 I can query the data in the databases and use it to create new data or edit data.

  ## Installation Instructions
  This project uses mySQL2, inquirer, and the console.table package. Must first run mySQL and run source db/schema.sql to use the database, and then run source db/seeds.sql to seed the data (or seed your own data). Then after quitting out of mySQL the user can run node index to begin the application.
